Regular expresion
grep -E "(my|false)" /etc/passwd
grep -E "(my.*false)" /etc/passwd # it's .* similiar like and operator
grep -E "my" /etc/passwd | grep -E "false"

.* = working && operator



Here are some optional tasks to practice regex that can help us to handle it better and more efficiently. For all exercises, we will use the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file on our Pwnbox instance.

1	Show all lines that do not contain the '#' character.
Ans: ' ^[^#]*$ '
Explain:
 - '^' matches the beginning of a line.
 - ' [^#]* ' matches any sequence of characters that does not include #.
 - ' $ ' matches the end of a line.

2	Search all lines that contain a word that starts with 'Permit'.
Ans : ' \bPermit\w* '
Explain:
  - ' \b ' asserts a word boundary.
  - ' Permit ' matches the literal word "Permit".
  - ' \w* ' matches zero or more word characters after "Permit".


3	Search all lines that contain a word ending with 'Authentication'.
Ans : ' \b\w*Authentication\b '
Explain:
  - ' \b ' asserts word boundaries at the start and end.
  - ' \w* ' matches zero or more word characters before "Authentication".
  - ' Authentication ' matches the literal text.

4	Search all lines containing the word 'Key'.
Ans: ' \bKey\b '

5	Search all lines beginning with 'Password' and containing 'yes'.
Ans: ' ^Password.*\byes\b '
Explain:
  - '^' matches the beginning of a line.
  - 'Password' matches the literal text "Password".
  - '.*' matches any sequence of characters.
  - ' \byes\b ' matches the word "yes".

6	Search all lines that end with yes.
Ans: ' yes\.$ '
Explain:
  - ' yes ' matches the literal text "yes".
  - ' \. ' matches the period (escaped because . is a special character).
  - ' $ ' matches the end of a line.
