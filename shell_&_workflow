Use cURL from your Pwnbox (not the target machine) to obtain the source code of the "https://www.inlanefreight.com" website and filter all unique paths of that domain. Submit the number of these paths as the answer.
curl https://www.inlanefreight.com/ | tr " " "\n" | grep -oE 'https://www.inlanefreight.com/([^"#]+)' | sort -u | wc -l


grep -oE ➡ The -o flag means to print only the matching characters, and not the full line. And the flag E means that it will allow us to use RegEx (Regular Expression) in this.
([^"#]+) ➡ This a regular expression which means, do not print " or # in the urls, but print and anything after it (full url).
